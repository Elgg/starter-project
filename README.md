Elgg Starter Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Elgg/starter-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Elgg/starter-project)
====

This is an experimental quickstart skeleton for building a site based on Elgg 2.0.

**Do not use this in production!** A stable release of 2.0 is not yet available; this will install the latest version on the `2.0` branch, containing very recent fixes. When 2.0 is released, this will point to the latest stable version.

## Installation

Follow the instructions for [installing Elgg with Composer](http://learn.elgg.org/en/2.0/intro/install.html#overview).
